                            in reality, for people living in poverty, it's not a simple win or lose, and decisions are affected by more factors.<br/>
                            however, we hope that this game gave you some insight into the difficult decisions that the poor must make to survive.<br/>
                            As of 2020, about half of the worldâ€™s population live on or live with less than $2.50 in a day.
